# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Auth-protected via get_current_user dependency. Real Google Distance Matrix branch present for when the key is added later."

        comment: "Full backend test suite run via /app/backend_test.py against the public preview URL — 14/14 PASSED. Specifically for POST /api/maps/travel-time: (a) happy path returns 200 with correct shape {duration_minutes:int, duration_in_traffic_minutes:int, distance_km:float, status:'fallback', cached:bool}; (b) first call returns cached=false, immediate second call with identical payload returns cached=true (5-min in-memory cache works); (c) deterministic mock — same origin/destination returns identical numbers across calls, distinct payloads produce different numbers; (d) auth gating — missing Authorization header → 401, invalid bearer token → 401; (e) departure_at ISO timestamp accepted and still returns correct fallback shape. Regression smoke also green: /api/auth/login works for both demo accounts, /api/auth/me returns instructor profile, /api/billing/create-checkout-session returns a real Stripe checkout URL (checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_...), /api/instructor/invite-student returns invite_token + invite_url containing ?invite=<jwt>. No 5xx errors observed in backend logs during the run."

Verified both views via Playwright screenshots — Day view shows 2-hour block for Oliver 09:00–11:00 spanning two hour slots with full name and topic; Week view shows the same lessons across 7 day columns with full names.

Confirmation uses Alert on native + window.confirm on web. Extended StudentStatus to include 'Passed' (mockDb.ts) and added markStudentPassed/updateStudent/deleteStudent helpers. StatusBadge updated for the new state. Verified end-to-end via Playwright: Amend sheet renders all fields with current values; Passed action switches the status badge to 'Passed' and bumps Driving readiness to 100%; CRM filter now includes a 'Passed' chip."
